The year 2023 posed several challenges for me. I navigated through two job changes within the same year, finally securing a position that brings stability. Amidst juggling work, university, and other commitments, I haven't been as productive as I would have liked to be. I have been able to accomplish some of my goals. But it seems to have done a bit better than the previous year.

## 2023 Highlights

Reflecting on the key moments of 2023:

- Successfully securing a position in a company that aligns with my preferences, bringing satisfaction.
- Exploring domestic destinations like [Sylhet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylhet) and [Sitakunda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitakunda) with friends.
- Maintaining consistent grades at university.
- Expanding my circle by making new friends on campus.
- The decision to establish and develop this blog site.

## 2023 Evaluation

An assessment of the goals set for 2023:

1. Become a better developer.
2. Improve my communication skills.
3. Build better personal habits.

I'd say I have been able to accomplish the first goal a bit. I have been able to learn a lot of new things and have been able to apply them in my work. I have also tried to improve my communication skills. I have been able to talk to people more and have been able to make some new friends. I have also been able to improve my writing skills a bit. But still, I have a long way to go. I have also been able to build some better personal habits but not all. But I still need to work on my diet, my sleep schedule and regular exercise.

# 2024 Goals

Setting ambitious targets for the upcoming year:

## 1. Build better personal habits

Priorities include maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, adopting a healthier diet, and incorporating regular exercise. The primary goal is to establish the routine of commencing each day after Fajr prayer, emphasizing consistency.

## 2. Write at least one line of code every day

Committing to daily coding, regardless of project size, to foster consistency, productivity, and continuous learning.

## 3. Spend at least 15 hours weekly on coding side projects

What I learnt is from building projects to solve real-wold problems and this is the best way to learn something effectively. I have been able to work on some side projects in the past but I need to be more consistent. I will dedicately spend at least 15 hours per week working on side projects to build some cool stuff.

## 4. Contribute to OSS

I have contributed a negligible amount to OSS in the past. I must need to contribute more. So, I listed some projects of my interest and will try to contribute to them. I will also try to contribute to some other projects that I find interesting.

## 5. Write at least 5-10 blog posts

In order to build a regular writing habit, I planned to build this blog site and got it done in November 2023. So far I have written 3 blog posts. So I have a goal to write at least 5-10 blog posts in the year 2024. I have some ideas for blog posts, I just need to write them down inchmeal.

## 6. Regularly engage in physical exercise, preferably at a gym

I have gained a good amount of weight in the past few years. I need to lose some weight and get in shape. I have plan to go to a gym 4 days a week to lose some weight and gain some muscle. I also need to maintain a healthy diet.

## 7. Learn to recite the Quran with proper tajweed

I have been able to recite the Quran but I don't know how to recite it properly. I need to learn to recite the Quran with proper tajweed. I have been able to learn some of the rules of tajweed but I need to learn more from a teacher.

## 8. Plan and go on a international trip

I have been to some places in the country but I have never been to any other country. I want to go on a international trip with my friends. I have been planning to go to [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India) for a long time. I hope I will be able to go there this year and also visit some other countries if possible.

## 9. Become a better developer

I have learnt some cloud stuffs in the past year and also gained some knowledge on advanced frontend concepts. I have learned and work with Astro and Svelte. I want to learn more backend stuff and cloud technologies this year.

## 10. Improve my communication skills

Continuing the journey to enhance communication, focusing on increased interaction, forging new connections, and refining writing skills through increased social media and blog engagement.

# Conclusion

These goals for 2024 are ambitious, and I'm eager to see them materialize. A year-end review post will evaluate the outcomes, aiming for accomplishment and growth. Follow my journey on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jubayeramb) and [GitHub](https://github.com/jubayeramb).
