The year 2024 was a great year, but it didnâ€™t go as planned for me. I had some goals set for the year, but I wasnâ€™t able to accomplish most of them. While I managed to achieve a few of my goals, it obviously wasnâ€™t enough. To be honest, Iâ€™m not happy with my progress this year. However, I finally took the time to sit down, reflect on the year, and set goals for the next one. I hope 2025 will be in my favor, and Iâ€™ll see some positive progress in my life.

## 2024 Highlights

Reflecting on the key moments of 2024:

- Designed and developed a product MVP single-handedly and launched it for my company.
- Explored domestic destinations like [St. Martin's Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Martin%27s_Island) and [Tanguar Haor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanguar_Haor) with friends.
- Maintained consistent grades at university.
- Expanded my circle by making new friends on campus.

## 2024 Evaluation

An assessment of the goals set for 2024:

1. Build better personal habits.
2. Write at least one line of code every day.
3. Spend at least 15 hours weekly on coding side projects.
4. Contribute to OSS.
5. Write at least 5-10 blog posts.
6. Regularly engage in physical exercise, preferably at a gym.
7. Learn to recite the Quran with proper tajweed.

I couldnâ€™t accomplish most of the goals I set for 2024. Although I tried, I wasnâ€™t able to fix my sleep schedule properly. I also tried to stay consistent with coding, but it wasnâ€™t possible to code every day. The biggest [Student Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Bangladesh_quota_reform_movement) in Bangladesh left us mentally exhausted; the internet was shut down for a long time, and I couldnâ€™t work properly.

I failed to start any side projects or contribute to OSS. I didnâ€™t even write a single blog post this yearâ€”I almost forgot about this blog site! Other goals, like going to the gym, losing weight, and learning to recite the Quran with proper tajweed, were also left unaccomplished.

These unachieved goals will be carried forward to my next yearâ€™s checklist. Letâ€™s see if I can turn them into reality this time.

# 2025 Goals

Setting ambitious targets for the upcoming year:

**_No new goals are added. The unaccomplished goals from 2024 will be carried forward to 2025._**

## 1. Build better personal habits

Priorities include maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, adopting a healthier diet, and incorporating regular exercise. My primary goal is to establish a routine that starts each day after the Fajr prayer, emphasizing consistency.

## 2. Spend at least 15 hours weekly on coding side projects

From building projects to solving real-world problems, Iâ€™ve learned that this is the best way to learn effectively. While Iâ€™ve worked on some side projects in the past, I need to be more consistent. I will dedicate at least 15 hours weekly to working on side projects to create something impactful.

## 3. Contribute to OSS

Iâ€™ve contributed a negligible amount to OSS in the past, and I must do more. Iâ€™ve listed some projects of interest and will try to contribute to them. Iâ€™ll also explore and contribute to other interesting projects I come across.

## 4. Write at least 5-10 blog posts

To build a regular writing habit, I planned and launched this blog site in November 2023. So far, Iâ€™ve written three blog posts. My goal is to write at least 5â€“10 blog posts in 2025. I already have some ideasâ€”I just need to work on them incrementally.

## 5. Regularly engage in physical exercise, preferably at a gym

Iâ€™ve gained significant weight in the past few years. I need to lose weight and get in shape. My plan is to visit the gym four days a week to shed some weight and gain muscle. A healthy diet will also be crucial.

## 6. Learn to recite the Quran with proper tajweed

While I know how to recite the Quran, I havenâ€™t mastered proper tajweed. Iâ€™ve learned some of the rules but need further guidance from a teacher.

## 7. Plan and go on a international trip

Iâ€™ve visited several places within the country but have never traveled abroad. I have been planning to visit [Nepal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal) or [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India) for a long time. I hope to make it happen this year and perhaps visit other countries if possible.

## 8. Become a better developer

This year, I explored cloud computing and advanced front-end concepts. Iâ€™ve learned and worked with tools like Astro and Svelte. My focus in 2025 will be to delve deeper into backend development and cloud technologies.

## 9. Improve communication skills

Iâ€™ve made progress in improving my communication skills, such as speaking with people more confidently and making new friends. Iâ€™ve also improved my writing skills slightly. However, thereâ€™s still room for significant growth, particularly in maintaining a healthy routine and consistent diet and exercise.

# Conclusion

2024 was a year of mixed emotions. While I experienced some great moments, I also faced challenges. I couldnâ€™t accomplish most of my goals, but I learned a lot from my failures.

Iâ€™ve carried forward my unachieved goals to 2025, and I hope not to move them forward again! I aim to make 2025 a year of success and positivity.
